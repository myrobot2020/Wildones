Package for Shiny app using Wildlife data

This readme is for a shiny app built for a wildlife group:

The task is to build a Shiny app that visualizes observed species on a map using biodiversity data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. 
Users should be able to search for species by vernacular and scientific name, view a timeline of species observations and have a sensible default view. 
The app should be decomposed into shinyModules, include unit tests and be deployed to shinyapps.io. 
Optional features include a beautiful UI using CSS and Sass, performance optimization, JavaScript for non-trivial visualizations
and finally deploying to a personal instance on a cloud provider.

The application has been built covering every single requriement the client requested and more:
